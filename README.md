## Description  :computer:
Kath and Dav's Shell is a simple UNIX command interpreter that replicates functionalities of the simple shell (sh). Additional functions are also included. This program was written entirely in C.

## Installation :computer:
Clone this repository into your working directory. For best results, files should be compiled with GCC and the following flags: -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -Wno-format.

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic -o shell *c
```

## Usage :computer:
After compilation, the resulting program can run stand-alone, either in interactive or non-interactive mode.


### Interactive Mode
```
simple_shell$ ./shell
```

### Non-Interactive Mode
```
simple_shell$ echo "ls -ls" | ./shell
```
Our shell has support for the following built-in commands:


| Command             | Definition                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| exit [n]            | Exit the shell, with an optional exit status, n.                                          |
| env                 | Print the environment.|



## Outside Programs :computer:

Our shell can run outside programs by typing their absolute paths (/bin/ls) or the executable name (ls), IF their directory is included in the PATH.

### Examples :computer:

```sh
katydav$ ls -l
total 8
drwxrwxr-x 1 vagrant vagrant Apr 2 13:23 directory_1
drwxrwxr-x 2 vagrant vagrant Apr 2 20:30 directory_2
```

```sh
katydav$ /bin/pwd
/home/vagrant/shell
```

```sh
katydav$ hello world
./hsh: 1: hello: not found
```
